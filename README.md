# .dev - Building Community-Requested Apps with AI

Welcome to the .dev project repository! We're a community of developers, AI enthusiasts, and innovative thinkers working together to create apps that solve real-world problems.

## 🚀 About the Project

.dev is a platform that brings together people with ideas and the developers who can make them happen. We use AI to streamline the development process, making it faster and more efficient. Our goal? To create applications that people actually need and want to use.

## 🌟 Key Features

- Community-Requested Apps: Your ideas drive our projects. Got a problem that needs solving? We're all ears.
- Live Coding Sessions: Watch and learn as we build apps in real-time. It's like a cooking show, but with more semicolons.
- Free Hosting: We don't just build the apps; we host them too. No strings attached.
- Open Source: All our code is open source. Feel free to peek under the hood and even contribute!
